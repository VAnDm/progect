This repository represents full cycle of the devekoping ML model, starting with searching images for dataset and inference itself.

Goal of the progect - to create a ML model that generates a drawn picture from a photo
UGATIT.py - ML model code
face_segment.py - code for searching faces on pictures and creating faces without background
Inference.py - code inference of the model based on the chosen domen and styling the video from your webcam 
Comparator - code for comparing original image and face without background to find images with white background

In the future we are planning to improve metrics of the trainig of the model and create user-friendly GUI.
